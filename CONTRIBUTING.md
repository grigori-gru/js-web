# Contributing to JS-Web Framework

Hello and thanks for your interest in our project!

## Developer documentation

If you are a developer and want to contribute please check our [documentation](http://js-web-framework.com/).

## Reporting issues

JS-Web uses GitHub’s integrated issue tracking system to record bugs and feature requests. If you want to raise an issue, please follow the recommendations below:

- Before you submit an issue, please search the [issue tracker](https://github.com/simonsmadsen/js-web/issues) to see if someone has already reported the problem.
- If the issue doesn’t already exist, create a new issue.
- Please provide as much information as possible with the issue report, we like to know the version of JS-Web that you are using, as well as your Operating System and Node version.
- If possible try to create a test-case or project that replicates the issue.

Some of them are easier than others. The [easy](https://github.com/simonsmadsen/js-web/labels/easy)
label can be used to find the easy issues.
